# Snake-Cogs
Cogs repo for my personal Red-Bot discord installation. 


To add cogs, use ```[p]cog repo add snake-cogs https://github.com/samclane/Snake-Cogs```

Check if there are any dependancies, and install them using pip3

The wiki is up. I currently only have the command helps up, but I'll be adding more cog info as I see fit.
